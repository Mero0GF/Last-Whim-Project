# About the Game
The project is a game in Unity implemented by Lucas Meres, Pedro Volpe, Eric Uchiyamada, Oliver Mccormack, Thiago Liporace, Renan Tagliaferro, and Cauê Macedo. <br>
"Last Whim" is a top-down shooter game focused on speed and difficulty, featuring two main bosses, "The Watcher" and "The Avatar." These two bosses were designed to present a certain level of challenge until they are defeated, thus providing a more rewarding experience for the player. <br>
Besides these two bosses representing combat, the game includes mechanics such as attack, dodge, "save at checkpoints," "cutscenes," environment, among others of lesser importance. <br>
